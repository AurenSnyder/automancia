## INSTALL

1) place these files into the same directory as Cinco Paus.exe
2) cd into the same directory as Cinco Paus.exe
3) python -m http.server
4) navigate to http://localhost:8000/ in firefox (other browsers also likely work, but haven't been tested)

## WHAT THIS DOES

 • automatically enters a bunch of stuff (but not everything) into cincomancia
 • displays the frog timer
 • displays parity with the incoming frog at both entrance and exit
 • displays enemy parity (via the presence or absence of a green dot on enemies)
 • displays which wand effect the wizard is standing on
 • if you have five keys, it will track which walls you've checked for the secret exit and the location of the secret exit if you've found it

## HOW TO USE

move around in cinco paus. pause after each move to let automancia catch up. it will (mostly) automatically track the game state.

after using a wand, you will need to specify which direction you fired it.

if you use a wand to refresh itself, automancia won't detect it. sorry about that :/

this is an experimental build, please expect some bugs and don't 100% rely on it if you're doing a serious run. if you find a bug, message me (Auren#3201) about it in the cinco paus discord! thanks!
